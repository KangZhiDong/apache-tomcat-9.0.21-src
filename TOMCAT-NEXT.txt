Notes of things to consider for the next major Tomcat release (10.0.x)

Items carried over from the 9.0.x list:

1.  Remove the use of system properties to control configuration wherever
    possible.

2.  Reduce instances of setters and getters for the same property existing on an
    object and its parent. This may require new objects to be exposed via JMX.

3.  Consider wrapping the SocketWrapper with a facade to detect / prevent
    components retaining references longer than they should.

New items for 10.0.x onwards:

 1.  Remove APR connector.

 2.  Remove org.apache.tomcat.jni and replace with the minimum necessary to
     interface with OpenSSL and clones.
     We might want to park this one until we see what is available direct from
     the JRE with project Panama.

 3.  Remove the ExtensionValidator and associated classes (assuming that the
     minimum Java version is Java 9 or later).

 4.  Clean-up content-type header processing. Remove the optional space after
     the ';' character (if any). Don't mutate the header if there is no charset
     parameter. See BZ 62912 for some discussion and additional references.

 5.  Consider applying the delayed log file opening (until there is something to
     log). See BZ 53620.

 6. Consider including
    <request-character-encoding>UTF-8</request-character-encoding>
    in conf/web.xml

 7. Consider including
    <response-character-encoding>UTF-8</response-character-encoding>
    in conf/web.xml

 8. RFC 3986 states (section 2.2) that a %nn encoded delimiter is NOT equivalent
    to the decoded form. Provide an option not to decode delimiters in %nn form.

 9. BZ 56966. Refactor internal request timing to use System.nanoTime()

10. BZ 63286. Make behaviour of %D and %T consistent with httpd.
